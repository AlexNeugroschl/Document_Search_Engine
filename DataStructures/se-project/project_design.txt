Flashcard project
-------------------
Stage 1:
For this project, we will create a commandline flashcard system to help facilitate effective studying for students and learners in general. Users will be able to add and delete cards, search for individual cards, see a list of all cards, or use a player to go through the cards strategically. The player will implement spaced repetition techniques to achieve maximal effectiveness.

Stage 2:

DATA:
There will be 3 files:
Flashcard.java
CardStore.java
CardPlayer.java

Flashcard.java will have the following:
String cardFront;
String cardBack;
int difficulty; //to determine how often it should come up in the player
int timeInHeap;
 
CardStore.java will have the following:
a sub class Deck.java
List<Deck> decks;

Deck.java will have the following:
MaxHeap<Flashcard> playerPriority;
Trie<Flashcard> cards;
CardPlayer player.java;

CardPlayer.java will statically feed from the heap to the commandline and update the values in Flashcard


DATA STRUCTURES:
We chose a list to store the decks because we only expect there to ever be a handful at a time.
We chose a MaxHeap to feed the CardPlayer because we want to feed them based off of the difficulty of the card and when it was last seen.
We chose a Trie to store the cards in generally because it is quick for adding, deleting, and can easily display a list of all cards in alphabetic order.
