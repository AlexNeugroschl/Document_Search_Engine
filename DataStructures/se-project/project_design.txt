Flashcard project
-------------------
For this project, we will create a commandline flashcard system to help facilitate effective studying for students and learners in general. Users will be able to add and delete cards, search for individual cards, see a list of all cards, or use a player to go throught the cards strategically. The player will implement spaced repetition techniques to achieve maximal effectiveness.
